# Coding-Quiz

## This is a work in progress and not working 100% yet.



## Application description
The brief was to create a coding quiz using HTML, CSS and javaScript.

## How it works
When the user clicks the start button they are presented with a series of javaScrip-related questions and multiple choice answers. When the user clicks start a timer starts on the top right of the screen. For each correct answer the user gets 10 points and moves on to the next question. For each incorrect answer 10 seconds is deducted from the timer. Once the time is up or the user answers all the questions the user is given their score and asked to enter their name for the highscore list. 

## Known issues
- Score system needs work, it currently only logs 10 point maximum.
- Highscore system needs more integration. The user score and name is written to local storage, but this information needs to be appended to the highscore list correctly.
